# transientflow-1d

**transientflow-1d** is a C++-based simulation tool developed to model **1D unsteady fluid flow** through a channel using fundamental conservation laws. It applies the **Finite Volume Method (FVM)** with time-only discretization, solving governing equations for both **compressible and incompressible flows** under the influence of heat transfer and frictional forces.

## Key Features

- Solves 1D transient fluid dynamics problems
- Handles both compressible and incompressible regimes
- Incorporates frictional and thermal source terms
- Based on conservation of mass, momentum, and energy
- Efficient single control-volume time-stepping approach
- Suitable for research, engineering applications, and learning

## Governing Equations

The simulation is governed by the following:

- **Continuity Equation:**  
  ∂ρ/∂t + ∂(ρu)/∂x = 0

- **Momentum Equation:**  
  ∂(ρu)/∂t + ∂(ρu²)/∂x = -∂p/∂x + Ḟ_fr

- **Energy Equation (Ideal Gas):**  
  ∂(ρCvT)/∂t + ∂(ρCvTu)/∂x = -p ∂u/∂x + ∂/∂x(k ∂T/∂x) + Ḟ_fr u


## Input Parameters

Defined at the west face (inlet):
- `p1` – Static pressure
- `u1` – Velocity
- `h01` or `T1` – Total enthalpy or temperature
- `Ffr` – Frictional force
- `Q` – Heat input

Computed at the east face (outlet):
- `p2`, `u2`, `h02`

## Simulation Workflow

1. Initialize physical properties and boundary conditions
2. Loop through time steps (`Δt`)
3. Sequentially solve:
   - Continuity equation
   - Momentum equation
   - Energy equation
4. Update variables and store results

## Technologies
